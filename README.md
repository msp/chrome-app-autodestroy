# chrome-app-autodestroy
Sell people an audio/visual app who's content self destructs. One day Rodney..

Like, it's a Chrome app, but it's also a website. Magic.
That means you can see it [on divshot](http://development.chrome-app-autodestroy.divshot.io), though I'm not promising anything likes.

Some stuff I should definitely remember not to forget:

* [Two Dimensional Noise](http://natureofcode.com/book/introduction/)
* [SVG Path Strings](http://roadtolarissa.com/blog/2015/02/22/svg-path-strings/)
* [Yeoman Chrome app generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-chromeapp)
* [SMIL](http://css-tricks.com/guide-svg-animations-smil/)
